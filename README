AGENDA

1. Layout Components

   Components should not know where they are being displayed.
   Components passed as children, not as props.
   Props passed directly into Components.

2. Lists and List Items

   Component (like SmallPersonListItem) type can be passed to a List (like RegularList)
   Resource (like person) name can be passed as props name.

3. Modals

   Well structured Component (like SmallPersonDetails/SmallPersonListItem) can be used inside both, a Modal and a List.

4. Container Components

   Components that take care of loading and managing data for their child Components.
   Our Components (besides Container Components) should not know where their data is coming from.
   Generic type of Loader to load any type of resource from the server.
   Taking it even one step further: DataSource Component, which does not even know where its data is coming from. (getDataFunc passed as prop)
