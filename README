AGENDA

1. Layout Components

   Components should not know where they are being displayed.
   Components passed as children, not as props.
   Props passed directly into Components.

2. Lists and List Items

   Component (like SmallPersonListItem) type can be passed to a List (like RegularList)
   Resource (like person) name can be passed as props name.

3. Modals

   Well structured Component (like SmallPersonDetails/SmallPersonListItem) can be used inside both, a Modal and a List.
